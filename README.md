Product Preview Card

I had troubles switching images from mobile to desktop.

With the help of chatGPT I learned about using content: url("images/image-product-desktop.jpg");

This allowed me to make the change I needed in my media query.

I learned that when making a button the img has to go inside of the <a> element
